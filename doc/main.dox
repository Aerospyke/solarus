This is the documentation of the C++ code of Solarus.
Solarus is a free, open-source engine for Zelda-like 2D games.

The engine is an executable binary that can run a quest.
A quest is a data package containing the graphics, the sounds, the maps
and the dialogs.

The engine classes are organized in several directories:
- (root directory): the main classes of the engine;
- lowlevel: encapsulates all libraries and provides low-level access to resources
  (the rest of the code is independent from libraries like SDL, OpenAL, etc.);
- menus: the menus displayed before or during the game;
- entities: all objects that are present on a map: the tiles, the hero, the enemies, the chests, etc.
  (most of the code is there);
- enemies: all types of enemies with their specific behavior;
- movements: many types of movements that can be applied to objects;
- hud: the head-up display that appears during the game.
