/**
\page lua_api Lua scripting API specification

This is the API specification of Lua functions and types defined by Solarus.
This documentation page is intented to quest makers who want to need to write
scripts for their maps, enemies and screens.
For the point of view of the engine, see the documentation of the C++ class
LuaContext.

Most of the data types defined in the C++ engine (like sprites, map entities,
movements, savagames, etc.) are exported as Lua types in the scripting API of
Solarus.
We give here the full specification of these types and the functions available
for each type.
The API exports C++ functions that may be called by your scripts.
Examples of such functions are creating a sprite, drawing an image or moving
an NPC.
In the opposite way, Solarus will also call your own Lua functions (if you
define them), for example to notify your script that an enemy has reached an
obstacle, that a timer has expired or that the player is talking to a
particular NPC.

The following types of scripts exist:
- The main script (\c main.lua): global script that controls the menus before
  starting a game.
- The script of a map (\c maps/mapXXXX.lua): controls the map \c XXXX.
- The script of an enemy (\c enemies/XXXX.lua): controls an enemy whose
  breed is \c XXXX. Each instance of enemy has its own Lua context (in particular
  its own global values), even if several enemies of the same breed exist at the
  same time on the current map.
- The script of an item (\c items/XXXX.lua): controls the item named
  \c XXXX in \c items.dat. For each item, only one Lua context is created for
  the whole game and it persists across map changes.

\todo Merge all types of scripts into a single, shared Lua context.

A Lua script can call the engine (and be called by it)
through a global table called \c sol. This table is automatically created
when your script is loaded by the engine.
The whole Solarus Lua API is available in the \c sol table.
It contains modules, functions, types and values that allow you to
interact with the C++ engine.

The following modules are defined in the \c sol table.

- \subpage lua_api_main "sol.main": some general-purpose functions.
- \subpage lua_api_audio "sol.audio": playing musics and sounds.
- \subpage lua_api_video "sol.video": changing the video mode.
- \subpage lua_api_input "sol.input": handling low-level input events
- \subpage lua_api_language "sol.language": handling translations.
  (keyboard and joypad).
- \subpage lua_api_menu "sol.menu": handling a scripted menu.
- \subpage lua_api_timer "sol.timer": making an action later with a delay.
- \subpage lua_api_sprite "sol.sprite": displaying animated images.
- \subpage lua_api_surface "sol.surface": displaying fixed images.
- \subpage lua_api_text_surface "sol.text_surface": displaying text.
- \subpage lua_api_movement "sol.movement": creating and managing movements.
- \subpage lua_api_game "sol.game": handling savegames
  and data saved (life, equipment, etc.).
- \subpage lua_api_map "sol.map": handling the map and entities
  placed on the map (only during a game).
- \subpage lua_api_item "sol.item": controls a particular type of
  equipment item and its behavior.
- \subpage lua_api_enemy "sol.enemy": controls an instance of an enemy.

See the specification page of each module for more details.
