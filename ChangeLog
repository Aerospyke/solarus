This ChangeLog describes the important changes of each svn commit.

r1418 (2010-09-08):

- Update all existing Lua scripts to match the new API.
- New functions in the Lua API:
  equipment_has_ability(ability_name)
  equipment_has_item(item_name)
  equipment_has_item_amount(item_name, amount)

r1417 (2010-09-08):

- Removed the class DungeonEquipment. The class Equipment will handle all items in
a more abstract way and does not need the dungeon-specific items to be
separated anymore.
- Important changes in the Lua API:

Functions changed or added:

equipment_get_money()						name changed (was equipment_get_rupees())
equipment_add_money(money)					new function
equipment_remove_money(money)					name changed (was equipment_remove_rupees(rupees))
equipment_get_life()						new function
equipment_add_life(life)					new function
equipment_remove_life(life)					new function
equipment_get_ability(ability_name)				new function (replaces equipment_get_tunic(), equipment_get_sword() and equipment_get_shield())
equipment_get_item(item_name)					name and parameter changed (was inventory_item_get(item_id))
equipment_set_item(item_name, variant)				name and parameter changed (was inventory_item_set(item_id, variant))
equipment_get_item_amount(item_name)				name and parameter changed (was inventory_item_get_amount(item_id))
equipment_add_item_amount(item_name, amount)			new function
equipment_remove_item_amount(item_name, amount)			name and parameter changed (was inventory_item_remove_amount(item_id, amount))
event_hero_interaction_item(entity_name, item_name, variant)	paramater changed (was event_hero_interaction_item(entity_name, item_id, variant)

Functions removed from the API:

inventory_item_is_bottle(item_id)
equipment_get_tunic()
equipment_get_sword()
equipment_get_shield()

The existing scripts will need to be updated.
Recall that the prototypes of treasure_give, treasure_give_with_amount,
event_treasure_obtaining and event_treasure_obtained also have changed.

r1413 (2010-09-07):

Still updating classes for the new item system.

r1413 (2010-09-05):

Change the Lua API of treasure functions to fit with the new item system: treasure_give,
treasure_give_with_amount, event_treasure_obtaining and
event_treasure_obtained.
The existing scripts that use these functions will need to be updated.

r1412 (2010-09-05):

Rewriting item-related classes. The interface of Equipment and Treasure have
changed in order to make them independent of a choice of items. This work is in progress, other classes will also change.
Add a class ItemProperties (not implemented yet) that will store the
properties of an item as described in the file quest.dat.

r1411 (2010-09-05):

Rename info.dat into quest.dat and change its syntax. This file will contain all
global information of the quest, including the list of items.

r1410 (2010-09-05):

Changing savegame format to make equipment items independent of the
engine.

I am working on a new item system to make all items
(treasures, equipment items, inventory items, pickable items, etc.) dependent of the quest
instead of being hardcoded in the engine. This will require many changes in the
existing code and you won't be able to compile the svn version soon.

A first step is to make important changes to the savegame format. The item
names were removed and some of them were replaced by a notion of abilities.
The existing savegame files are not compatible anymore and must be deleted.
