Solarus is an open-source Zelda-like game engine written in C++.
This engine is used by our Zelda fangame Zelda: Mystery of Solarus DX.
The Git repository of Solarus includes three subprojects:
- Solarus: the C++ engine,
- Zelda: Mystery of Solarus DX (or ZSDX for short): the game,
- Solarus Quest Editor: an editor for creating quests, written in Java.

Zelda: Mystery of Solarus DX is still under development, but
a demo version was released on December 18th, 2009.

or download the demo.
