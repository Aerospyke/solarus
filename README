This file explains how to compile Zelda Solarus Deluxe.
Only the developing team has to compile the project. To preserve the secrets of the game, the source code is not public.
The users download directly a compiled binary for Windows or Linux.

-----------------
Required packages
-----------------

The following libraries are required to make ZSDX work:

SDL
SDL_image
fmod-3.75

There exists SDL packages for Ubuntu:

libsdl-image1.2-dev
libsdl1.2-dev

But there is no FMOD package for Ubuntu. So you have to install the files manually:
- Download the FMOD archive: http://www.fmod.org/index.php/release/version/fmodapi375linux.tar.gz
- Create a directory for the FMOD .h files: /usr/include/fmod
- Copy into this directory every .h file from the subdirectory api/inc of the FMOD archive
- Copy api/libfmod-3.75.so into /usr/lib
- Make a symbolic link: sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libfmod-3.75.so /usr/lib/libfmod.so


------------------------
Compilation instructions
------------------------

To compile and install ZSDX, just use the standard Unix procedure:

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

This will install the zsdx binary in a default directory such as /usr/local/bin. So you must be root to run the last command. Then you can launch the game with the simple command:

$ zsdx

You can instead install the binary in another directory, so that no root access is necessary. You can specify this directory as a parameter of configure like this:

$ ./configure --prefix=/home/your_directory
$ make
$ make install

This will install the zsdx binary in /home/your_directory/bin. Then you can launch the game with:

$ /home/your_directory/bin/zsdx

or just with:

$ zsdx

if /home/your_directory/bin is in your PATH.


------------------
Windows developers
------------------

If you want to compile the application under Windows, the same procedure works in an Unix environment such as MinGW or Cygwin. A zsdx.exe file is generated.
