/*
 * By default, to decode SPC music files, the Snes_SPC library is used.
 * Snes_SPC is a recent SPC decoding library and exists in two versions:
 * - a fast version, that renders music with a very nice quality (recommended);
 * - a highly accurate version, that renders music with a better accuracy, but three times slower.
 * I recommend the fast version since the sound generated is good enough.
 * 
 * OpenSPC is an older SPC decoding library, as fast as the fast version of Snes_SPC,
 * but compatible only with i386 architectures because of assembly code.
 * To compile with OpenSPC instead of Snes_SPC,
 * define the preprocessor symbol USE_OPENSPC by uncommenting
 * the following line, or set it in your compilation command line
 * (for gcc, use the flag -DUSE_OPENSPC). 
 * The SPC library you will need to link to the executable depends on this choice.
