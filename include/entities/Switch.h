/**
 * @brief A button that the hero can trigger.
 *
 * A switch can be triggered by walking onto it
 * (then we call it a walkable switch) or by shooting an arrow towards it
 * (then we call it an arrow target).
 * Some walkable switches require a block to be enabled.
 * Some walkable switches become disabled when the hero or the block leave it.
 * A walkable switch can be visible or invisible.
 * An arrow target is always invisible.
