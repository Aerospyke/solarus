/**
 * @brief An entity that the hero can destroy and that may contain a pickable item.
 *
 * Some destructible items can be lifted and thrown (a pot, a stone, etc.),
 * some of them can be cut with the sword (for example some grass)
 * and others have both behaviors (for example a bush).
 * Some others can explode when they are lifted (a bomb or a bomb flower).
 * When the hero lifts an item, it is removed from the map and replaced by an instance of CarriedItem
 * that is attached to the hero.
