 * @brief A small fixed piece of the map.

 * It is composed of a tile pattern that can be repeated.
 * It can be an obstacle or not.
 * A tile cannot be removed from the map. Its pattern may be animated.
 * Tiles are optimized to allow fast detection of obstacles and
 * fast rendering of the non-animated ones.
