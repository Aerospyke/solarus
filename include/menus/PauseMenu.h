 * @brief The menus displayed when the game is paused.
 *
 * The pause menu is divided in four submenus:
 * - inventory,
 * - map,
 * - quest status,
 * - options.
 * Each submenu is a subclass of PauseSubmenu.
 * The player can switch between the submenu with
 * the directional keys. From any submenu, he can
 * save the game by pressing the sword key,
 * and resume the game by pressing the pause key.
