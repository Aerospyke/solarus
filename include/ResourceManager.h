/**
 * This class provides access to all external resources:
 * images, sounds, maps...
 * Except for the images, all resources are stored into
 * memory when you get them for the first time and you
 * don't have to delete them. They are deleted when the application
 * ends. This does not consumes much memory because:
 * - the maps and tilesets have an unload() method you can call,
 * - the musics and sounds close their audio files when they stop.
 * The images are the only kind of resources that you have to
 * free yourself.
