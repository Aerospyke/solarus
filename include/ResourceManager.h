/**
 * This class provides storage and access to some external resources:
 * maps, sounds, sprite animations...
 * Those resources are stored into
 * memory when you get them for the first time and you
 * don't have to delete them. They are deleted when the application
 * ends. This does not consumes much memory because:
 * - the maps and tilesets have an unload() method you can call,
 * - the musics and sounds close their audio files when they stop.
