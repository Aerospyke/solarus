 * A music should be in format .spc (Snes).
 * The .it format (Impulse Tracker Module) will probably be supported in a future version.
 * Only one music can be played at the same time.
 * Before using this class, the audio system should have been
 * initialized, by calling Sound::initialize().
 * Sound and Music are the only classes that depends on audio libraries.
