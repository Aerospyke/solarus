/**
 * @brief Represents an execution phase of the program.
 *
 * A screen is an execution phase of the program, like the title
 * screen, the selection menu or the game itself.
 * There is always a current screen and it is controlled by the main loop of the program.
 *
 * To create a screen, you have to implement a subclass of Screen.
 * The main loop will call three methods that you must implement:
 * - display(): to draw your screen on the main surface. This function
 * is called a certain number of times per second (which is the FPS number).
 * - update(): to update your screen's internal data (this function is
 * called repeatedly). This is useful to update the
 * state of objects that depend on time (e.g. the ones that are animated or moving).
 * - notify_input(): to take into account input events that occur
 * (such as a keyboard key or a joypad button that was just pressed).
 *
 * Basically, the program main loop calls these three functions. If it has enough
 * time (depending on how long are the update() and display() calls), it can choose
 * to sleep between two loops.
 *
 * When your screen is finished and you want to go to another screen,
 * you have to call set_next_screen() with the new screen as parameter.
