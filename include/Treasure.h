/**
 * @brief Represents an item that the hero brandishes when he receives it.
 *
 * Treasures include all items the hero can get in chest, buy in a shop
 * or get from the script (e.g. when talking to an NPC).
 * It also includes items picked on the ground if they are saved
 * (heart pieces, keys, etc.).
 * Picked items that are not saved (rupees, bombs, etc.) are not treasures since they are not brandished
 * when they are picked on the ground. When they come from a chest, they are
 * treasures.
 *
 * A treasure is represented as the following values:
 * - a savegame variable: index of the boolean variable that indicates whether
 *   the player has found this treasure (-1 if the treasure is not saved).
 * - the item name: a string identitying the nature of the treasure, according to the file quest.dat
 * - the variant: indicates the variant of this item
