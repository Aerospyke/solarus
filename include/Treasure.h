/**
 * A treasure is any item that the hero brandishes when he receives it.
 * It includes all items he can get in chest, buy a shop or get from the script
 * (e.g. when talking to an NPC).
 * It also includes items picked on the ground if they are saved
 * (heart pieces, keys, etc.).
 * Picked items that are not saved are not treasures since they are not brandished.
 *
 * A treasure is represented as the following three values:
 * - the treasure content: indicates the nature of the treasure: 20 rupees, a heart container,
 *   the map, a red potion, the bow, some bombs, etc;
 * - the amount: an optional integer indicating the number of items of this treasure
 *   (for bombs, rupees, croissants, etc.);
 * - a savegame variable: index of the boolean variable saved indicating whether
 *   the player has found this treasure (-1 if the treasure is not saved).
